Predicting Anaemia from Image Pixels and Hemoglobin Levels

Dataset Description This dataset is curated to facilitate the development of machine learning models aimed at predicting Predicting Anaemia from Image Pixels and Hemoglobin Levels

Dataset Description: This dataset is curated to facilitate the development of machine learning models aimed at predicting anaemia based on hemoglobin levels and color pixel distribution from associated images. Each row in the dataset corresponds to an individual case with various features

Columns:

Number:

Type: Integer

Description: A unique identifier for each individual case.

Sex:

Type: Categorical (Male, Female)

Description: The sex of the individual.

%Red Pixel:

Type: Float

Description: The percentage of red pixels in the image associated with the case.

%Green Pixel:

Type: Float

Description: The percentage of green pixels in the image associated with the case.

%Blue Pixel:

Type: Float

Description: The percentage of blue pixels in the image associated with the case.

Hb:

Type: Float

Description: Hemoglobin level of the individual, measured in grams per deciliter (g/dL).

Anaemic:

Type:Catagorical (Yes | No )

Description: An indicator of anaemia status (1 for anaemic, 0 for not anaemic). Usage

This dataset can be utilized for:
Developing and testing machine learning models to predict *anaemia. Analyzing the correlation between hemoglobin levels and color pixel distribution in images. Educational purposes for learning data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building. Acknowledgements. Please ensure proper citation if you use this dataset in your research or project.
