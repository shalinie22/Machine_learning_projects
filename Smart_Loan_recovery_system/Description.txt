To build a loan recovery system with Machine Learning, we will use a dataset containing borrower profiles, loan details, and repayment histories. This dataset includes critical attributes such as:

Demographic Information: Age, employment type, income level, and number of dependents.
Loan Details: Loan amount, tenure, interest rate, and collateral value.
Repayment History: Number of missed payments, days past due, and monthly EMI payments.
Collection Efforts: Collection methods used, number of recovery attempts, and legal actions taken.
Loan Recovery Status: Whether the loan was fully recovered, partially recovered, or remains outstanding.
